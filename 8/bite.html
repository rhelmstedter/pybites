<p>Write a function that rotates characters in a string, in both directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if n is positive move characters from beginning to end, e.g.: <code>rotate('hello', 2)</code> would return <em>llohe</em></li>
<li>if n is negative move characters to the start of the string, e.g.: <code>rotate('hello', -2)</code> would return <em>lohel</em></li>
</ul>
<p>See tests for more info. Have fun!</p>
